#  Marabou
Deep neural networks are revolutionizing the way complex systems are designed.
Instead of spending long hours hand-crafting complex software, many engineers
now opt to use deep neural networks (DNNs) - machine learning models, created by
training algorithms that generalize from a finite set of examples to previously
unseen inputs. Consequently, there is a pressing need for tools and techniques
for network analysis and certification. To help address that need, we present
Marabou, a framework for verifying deep neural networks. 

Marabou is an SMT-based tool that can answer queries about a networkâ€™s
properties by transforming these queries into constraint satisfaction problems.
It can accommodate networks with different activation functions and topologies,
and it performs high-level reasoning on the network that can curtail the search
space and improve performance. It also supports parallel execution to further
enhance scalability. Marabou accepts multiple input formats, including protocol
buffer files generated by the popular TensorFlow framework for neural networks.

A DNN verification query consists of two parts: (i) a neural network, and (ii) a
property to be checked; and its result is either a formal guarantee that the
network satisfies the property, or a concrete input for which the property is
violated (a counter-example). There are several types of verification queries
that Marabou can answer: 
* Reachability queries: if inputs is in a given range is the output
guaranteed to be in some, typically safe, range.
* Robustness queries: test whether there exist adversarial points around a given
  input point that change the output of the network.

Marabou supports fully connected feed-forward and convolutional NNs with
piece-wise linear activation functions, in the .nnet and TensorFlow formats.
Properties can be specified using inequalites over input and output variables or
via Python interface. 

For more details about the features of Marabou check out the [tool
paper](https://aisafety.stanford.edu/marabou/MarabouCAV2019.pdf) and the
[slides](https://aisafety.stanford.edu/marabou/fomlas19.html).

Download
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The latest version of Marabou is available on [http://github.com/GuyKatzz/Marabou].

## Static binaries

Pre-compiled binary for Linux is available:

[marabou-1.0-x86_64-linux.zip](https://aisafety.stanford.edu/marabou/marabou-1.0-x86_64-linux.zip)

Build and Dependencies
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marabou can be built on Linux and macOS. Marabou depends on the Boost library
which is automatically downloaded and built when you run make. Library CXXTEST
comes included in the repository.

Using Marabou through the Python interface requires Python 3. It may be useful
to set up a Python virtual environment, see
[here](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html) for more information.


To build Marabou, run the following:
```
cd path/to/marabou/repo/folder
make
```
The compiled binary will be in *./src/engine/marabou.elf*. 

The Python interface requires *pybind11*,  in addition to building Marabou, run:
```
cd maraboupy
make
```

Export maraboupy folder to Python and Jupyter paths:
```
PYTHONPATH=PYTHONPATH:/path/to/marabou/folder
JUPYTER_PATH=JUPYTER_PATH:/path/to/marabou/folder
```
and Marabou is ready to be used from a Python or a Jupyter script.

Getting Started
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
### To run Marabou from Command line 
After building Marabou the binary is located at *src/engine/marabou.elf*. The
repository contains sample networks and properties in the *resources* folder.
For more information see [resources/README.md](resources/README.md).

To run Marabou, execute from the repo directory, for example:

```
src/engine/marabou.elf resources/nnet/acasxu/ACASXU_experimental_v2a_2_7.nnet resources/properties/acas_property_3.txt
```


### Using Python interface 
The *maraboupy/examples* folder contains several python scripts and Jupyter
notebooks that can be used as starting points. 

### Using the Divide and Conquer (DNC) mode
In the DNC mode, activated by *--dnc* Marabou decomposes the problem into *n0*
sub-problems, specified by *--initial-divides=n0*. Each sub-problem will be
solved with initial timeout of *t0*, supplied by *--initial-timeout=t0*. Every
sub-problem that times out will be divided into *n* additional sub-problems,
*--num-online-divides=n*, and the timeout is multiplied by a factor of *f*,
*--timeout-factor=f*. Number of parallel threads *t* is specified by
*--num-workers=t*.

So to solve a problem in DNC mode with 4 initial splits and initial timeout of 5s, 4 splits on each timeout and a timeout factor of 1.5:
```
src/engine/marabou.elf resources/nnet/acasxu/ACASXU_experimental_v2a_2_7.nnet resources/properties/acas_property_3.txt --dnc --initial-divides=4 --initial-timeout=5 --num-online-divides=4 --timeout-factor=1.5 --num-workers=4
```
