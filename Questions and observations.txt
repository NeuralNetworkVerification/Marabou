Questions:
1. What is explicitBasisBoundTightening()?
2. 


Observations:
1. In the example from Chvatals book - Engine catches infeasible exception when calling the 
explicitBasisBoundTightening() function.
In second example (from Guy's lecture) - Marabou concludes that the formula is UNSAT from query preprocessing.


Future Step:
1. Handle general bound tightening.
2. Handle infeasibility from preprocessing bound tightening.
3. Handle infeasibility from BasisBoundTightening
