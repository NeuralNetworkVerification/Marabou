Questions:
1. What is explicitBasisBoundTightening()?
2. What is performMILPSolverBoundedTightening()?
3. When should the preprocessor declare UNSAT. What would be a sufficient certificate (Maybe vector of 1?)?
4. What is solveWithMILPEncoding()?


Observations:
1. In the example from Chvatals book - Engine catches infeasible exception when calling the 
explicitBasisBoundTightening() function.
In second example (from Guy's lecture) - Marabou concludes that the formula is UNSAT from query preprocessing.


Future Steps:
1. Handle general bound tightening.
2. Handle infeasibility from query preprocessing bound tightening.
3. Handle infeasibility from BasisBoundTightening
4. Consult Guy - should it be better to return certificate upon throwing an infeasibility Exception or upon catching it?
5. Add a constructor argument to infeasibleQueryException, that has the line which lead to infeasibility.
