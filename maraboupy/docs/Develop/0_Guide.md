This documentation describes the best practices and guidelines for contributing to Maraboupy.
Additional information about contributing to Marabou in general can be found in the [wiki](https://github.com/NeuralNetworkVerification/Marabou/wiki/Developer's-Guide).
Some of the information contained here originates from the Marabou wiki.

Contributors to Marabou are expected to [create their own
fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) of the Marabou repository. All
changes that should be merged into master should be submitted and reviewed via
[pull requests](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/). The
only exception to that rule are very minor changes (e.g., typos in comments) by
developers with write access which, may be pushed directly onto master after all
Travis builds succeeded.
