# Coding Style Guidelines

Writing code with a consistent style improves readability, reduces the chance of making errors, and 
allows automatic API documentation to be generated correctly. 
This page focuses only on python coding style. See the 
[wiki](https://github.com/NeuralNetworkVerification/Marabou/wiki/Coding-Guidelines)
for the C++ Marabou style guide. In addition, this page is relevant for writing source python files
in the maraboupy directory. For information on creating new tests, examples, or documentation, see
the other pages of documentation.
