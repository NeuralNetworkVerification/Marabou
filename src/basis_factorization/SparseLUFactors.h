/*
  This class provides supprot for an LU-factorization of a given matrix.

  The factorization has the following form:

     A = F * V = P * L * U * Q

     F = P * L * P'
     V = P * U * Q

  Where:
    - A is the matrix being factorized
    - L is lower triangular with all diagonal entries equal to 1
    - U is upper triangular
    - P and Q are permutation matrices

  Matrices F, V, P and Q are stored sparsely. Matrices
  U and L are not stored at all, as they are implied by the rest.

  On some cases, we may wish to use separate Ps for the F and V computation.
  While the same matrix is used for both by default, the class also supports
  setting a different P for the L computation. In this case, the main equation
  becomes A = FV = ( P1 L P1') * ( P U Q ).

  The class also provides functionality for basic computations involving
  the factorization.
