 **
 ** The CDSmtCore class implements a context-dependent SmtCore class.
 ** The CDSmtCore distinguishes between: **decisions** and **implications**.
 **
 ** Decision is a case of PiecewiseLinearConstraint asserted on the trail.
 ** A decision is a choice between multiple feasible cases of a
 ** PiecewiseLinearConstraint and represents nodes in the search tree.
 **
 ** Implication is the last feasible case of a PiecewiseLinearConstraint and as
 ** soon as it is detected it is asserted on the trail.
 **
 ** Case splitting on a PiecewiseLinearConstraint performs a decision.
 ** Fixing a case of a PiecewiseLinearConstraint (e.g., via bound propagation or
 ** by exhausting all other cases) performs an implication.
 **
 ** The overall search state is stored in a distributed way:
 ** - CDSmtCore::_trail is the current search state in a chronological order
 ** - PiecewiseLinearConstraints' infeasible cases enumerate all the explored
 ** states w.r.t to the chronological order on the _trail.
 **
 ** _trail is a chronological list of cases of PiecewiseLinearConstraints
 ** asserted to hold (as TrailEntries) - both decisions and implications.
 ** _decisions is a chronological list of decisions stored on the trail.
 ** _trail and _decisions are both context dependent and will synchronize in
 ** unison with the _context object.
 **
 ** When a search state is found to be infeasible, CDSmtCore backtracks to the
 ** last decision and continues the search.
 **
 ** PushDecision advances the decision level and context level.
 ** popDecisionLevel backtracks the last decision and context level.
 **
 ** Advancing a context level creates a synchronization point to which all
 ** context dependent members can backtrack in unison.
 ** Backtracking a context level restores all context dependent members to the
 ** state of the last synchronization point. This operation is O(1) complexity.
 **
 ** Since the entire search state is context dependent, backtracking the context
 ** (via popDecisionLevel) backtracks the entire Marabou search state.
 ** The only exception is the labeling of basic/non-basic variables in the
 ** tableau, which may need to be recalculated using Tableau's
 ** postContextPopHook exposed via Engine.
 **
 ** Implementation relies on:
 **
 ** - _context is a unique Context object from which all the context-dependent
 ** structures are obtained.
 **
 ** - PiecewiseLinearConstraint class stores its search state in a
 ** context-dependent manner and exposes it using nextFeasibleCase() and
 ** markInfeasible() methods.
 **
 ** - Using BoundManager class to store bounds in a context-dependent manner
