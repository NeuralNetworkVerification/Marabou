 **
 ** LeakyReluConstraint implements the following constraint:
 ** f = b if b > 0 else slope * b
 **
 ** It distinguishes two relevant phases for search:
 ** RELU_PHASE_ACTIVE   : b > 0 and f > 0
 ** RELU_PHASE_INACTIVE : b <=0 and f = 0
 **
 ** The constraint is implemented as PiecewiseLinearConstraint
 ** and operates in two modes:
 **   * pre-processing mode, which stores bounds locally, and
 **   * context dependent mode, used during the search.
 **
 ** Invoking initializeCDOs method activates the context dependent mode, and the
 ** LeakyReluConstraint object synchronizes its state automatically with the central
 ** Context object.
