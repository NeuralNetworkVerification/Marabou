 **
 ** MaxConstraint implements the following constraint:
 ** _f = Max( e1, e2, ..., eM), where _elements = { e1, e2, ..., eM}
 **
 ** MaxConstraint refers to elements as its phases, by wrapping the variable
 ** identifiers as PhaseStatus enumeration. It allows elimination of elements
 ** during preprocessing. Eliminated elements are abstracted in an aggregate
 ** local member _maxValueOfEliminated, and its phase is a reserved value
 ** PhaseStatus::MAX_PHASE_ELIMINATED.
 **
 ** The constraint is implemented as PiecewiseLinearConstraint
 ** and operates in two modes:
 **   * pre-processing mode, which stores bounds locally, and
 **   * context dependent mode, used during the search.
 **
 ** Invoking initializeCDOs method activates the context dependent mode, and the
 ** MaxConstraint object synchronizes its state automatically with the central
 ** Context object.
 **
 ** Invariants to maintain in this class:
 ** 1. All methods called after transformToUseAuxVariablesIfNeeded
 **    are operating under the assumption that f >= element for each
 **    element in _element, and f >= _maxValueofEliminatedVariables
 ** 2. _maxLowerBound keeps track of the maximal lower bound of the output of
 **    the MaxConstraint, it can be updated by notifyLowerBound(),
 **    notifyUpperBound(), eliminateVariable()
 ** 3. _phaseStatus is updated by notifyLowerBound(), notifyUpperBound(),
       eliminateVariable().
 ** 4. elements in _elements are feasible (wrt. current variable bounds) and
 **    _haveFeasibleEliminatedVariables are up-to-date. They are updated by
 **     notifyLowerBound(), notifyUpperBound(), eliminateVariable().
 ** 5. The constraint is _obsolete only when 1) all elements are eliminated
 **     (handled by eliminateVariable()); 2) _f is eliminated.
