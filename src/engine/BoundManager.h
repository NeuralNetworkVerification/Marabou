 **
 ** BoundManager class is a context-dependent implementation of a centralized
 ** variable registry and their bounds. The intent it so use a single
 ** BoundManager object between multiple bound tightener classes, which enables
 ** those classes to care only about bounds and forget about book-keeping.
 **
 ** BoundManager provides a method to obtain a new variable with:
 ** registerNewVariable().
 **
 ** The bound values and tighten flags are stored using context-dependent objects,
 ** which backtrack automatically with the central _context object.
 **
 ** There are two sets of methods to set bounds:
 **   * set*Bounds     - local method used to update bounds
 **   * tighten*Bounds - shared method to update bounds, propagates the new bounds
 **                        to the _tableau (if registered) to keep the assignment and
 **                      basic/non-basic variables updated accordingly.
 **
 ** As soon as bounds become inconsistent, i.e. lowerBound > upperBound, an
 ** InfeasableQueryException is thrown. In the long run, we want the exception
 ** replaced by a flag, and switch to the conflict analysis mode instead.
 **
 ** It is assumed that variables are not introduced on the fly, and as such
 ** interaction with context-dependent features is not implemented.
